# Atliq-Hospitality-Analytics

Excited to share my next project: "AtliQ Hospitality" Dashboard, made with help from Codebasics , Dhaval Patel and Hemanand Vadivel.
This dashboard gives insights into AtliQ Technologies Grand hotel chain's revenue trends and booking history.

Here's what you'll find:
1. Revenue
2. RevPAR (Revenue per available room)
3. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
4. Occupancy (%)
5. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
6. Realization (%)
7. DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights)
8. Succesfull bookings vs cancelation%.

Key takeaways:
1. Noticed a correlation between occupancy (%) and average rating. It's time to dig deeper into those bad ratings and address underlying issues.
2. Weekends vs. weekdays: Occupancy levels soar on weekends. Let's focus on maximizing revenue during peak times.
3. ADR stays steady regardless of occupancy (%) fluctuations. ðŸ’¡ Dynamic pricing could be the game-changer to capitalize on high occupancy rates and boost revenue.
